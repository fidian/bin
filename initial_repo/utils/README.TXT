This folder is for scripts or programs that might
be of use to developers or project managers but are
not part of the product itself.

This is place to "accumulate wisdom." If you write
a shell script that helps to find certain code, or
you write a script to automate a complex CVS action
or some such similar thing, put the script in here
for posterity.
