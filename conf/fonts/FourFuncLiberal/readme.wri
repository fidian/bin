FOUR FUNCTIONA true type font family by P.D. Magnuswww.fontmonkey.comFour Function is a family of fonts designed to look like LED calculator displays. 4Function Strict is a font that could actually be produced using only the elements on such a display: Some of the letters (like X) are rather stylized, and others (like A) have no distinct upper and lower case. 4Function Liberal uses diagonal lines and other elements to make the letters less stylized and give each letter two distinct cases. Both fonts are full alpha-numeric fonts with a smattering of punctuation.They were designed in PfaEdit.These fonts are copyright 2002 by P.D. Magnus. 'Font Monkey' is trademarks of P.D. Magnus.
